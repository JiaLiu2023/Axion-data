# Axion data for nucleon couplings 


This folder is intended to contain the constraints on axion couplings, specifically for neutron and proton couplings. The provided data is presented in a two-column format, where the first column represents the axion frequency in Hz, and the second column represents the coupling in GeV^-1. The data is categorized under HSR, which stands for Hybrid-Spin-Resonance mode, and SC, which stands for Self-Compensating mode, in a co-magnetometer. These data points are pertinent to the research paper available at the following link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08039.pdf.

Updated as of 2023.11.17:

The SC limits data has been updated using an improved calculation method that includes a more accurate assessment of background noise, while the averaged sensitivity remains unchanged. The HSR-SC combined limits, with enhanced sensitivity between the two, have been uploaded (named as All_gann/gapp.txt and utilized for the main-text figure), along with their separate limits.
