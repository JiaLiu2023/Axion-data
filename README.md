# Axion data for nucleon couplings 


This folder is intended to contain the constraints on axion couplings, specifically for neutron and proton couplings. The provided data is presented in a two-column format, where the first column represents the axion frequency in Hz, and the second column represents the coupling in GeV^-1. The data is categorized under HSR, which stands for Hybrid-Spin-Resonance mode, and SC, which stands for Self-Compensating mode, in a co-magnetometer. These data points are pertinent to the research paper available at the following link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08039.pdf.

Updata 2023.11.17
Update the SC limits data using improved calculation method with better assessment of background noise and the averaged sensitivity remain unchanged. 
Upload the HSR-SC combined limits with better sensitivity between the two (named as All_gann/gapp.txt and used for main-text figure) and their seperate limits.
